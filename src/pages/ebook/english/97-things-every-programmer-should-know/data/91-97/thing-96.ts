        It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to work out that good programmers write
        good code. Bad programmers... don't. They produce monstrosities that the
        rest of us have to clean up. You want to write the good stuff, right?
        You want to be a good programmer.

        Good code doesn't pop out of thin air. It isn't something that happens
        by luck when the planets align. To get good code you have to work at it.
        Hard. And you'll only get good code if you actually care about good
        code.

        Good programming is not born from mere technical competence. I've seen
        highly intellectual programmers who can produce intense and impressive
        algorithms, who know their language standard by heart, but who write the
        most awful code. It's painful to read, painful to use, and painful to
        modify. I've seen more humble programmers who stick to very simple code,
        but who write elegant and expressive programs that are a joy to work
        with.

        Based on my years of experience in the software factory, I've concluded
        that the real difference between adequate programmers and great
        programmers is this: <em>attitude</em>. Good programming lies in taking
        a professional approach, and wanting to write the best software you can,
        within the Real World constraints and pressures of the software factory.

        <em>The code to hell is paved with good intentions.</em> To be an
        excellent programmer you have to rise above good intentions, and
        actually <em>care</em> about the code — foster positive perspectives and
        develop healthy attitudes. Great code is carefully crafted by master
        artisans, not thoughtlessly hacked out by sloppy programmers or erected
        mysteriously by self-professed coding gurus.

        You want to write good code. You want to be a good programmer. So, you
        care about the code:
      </p>
      <ul dir="auto">
        <li>
          In any coding situation, you refuse to hack something that only seems
          to work. You strive to craft elegant code that is clearly correct (and
          has good tests to show that it is correct).
        </li>
        <li>
          You write code that is <em>discoverable</em> (that other programmers
          can easily pick up and understand), that is <em>maintainable</em> 
          (that you, or other programmers, will be easily able to modify in the
          future), and that is correct (you take all steps possible to determine
          that you have solved the problem, not just made it look like the
          program works).
        </li>
        <li>
          You work well alongside other programmers. No programmer is an island.
          Few programmers work alone; most work in a team of programmers, either
          in a company environment or on an open source project. You consider
          other programmers, and construct code that others can read. You want
          the team to write the best software possible, rather than to make
          yourself look clever.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any time you touch a piece of code you strive to leave it better than
          you found it (either better structured, better tested, more
          understandable...).
        </li>
        <li>
          You care about code and about programming, so you are constantly
          learning new languages, idioms, and techniques. But you only apply
          them when appropriate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p dir="auto">
        Fortunately, you're reading this collection of advice because you do
        care about code. It interests you. It's your passion. Have fun
        programming. Enjoy cutting code to solve tricky problems. Produce
        software that makes you proud.
