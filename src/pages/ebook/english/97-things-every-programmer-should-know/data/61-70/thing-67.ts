        <p dir="auto">
          The single most important trait of a professional programmer is 
          <em>personal responsibility</em>. Professional programmers take
          responsibility for their career, their estimates, their schedule
          commitments, their mistakes, and their workmanship. A professional
          programmer does not pass that responsibility off on others.
        </p>
        <ul dir="auto">
          <li>
            <p dir="auto">
              If you are a professional, then <em>you</em> are responsible for
              your own career. <em>You</em> are responsible for reading and
              learning. You are responsible for staying up-to-date with the
              industry and the technology. Too many programmers feel that it is
              their employer's job to train them. Sorry, this is just dead wrong.
              Do you think doctors behave that way? Do you think lawyers behave
              that way? No, they train themselves on their own time, and their own
              nickel. They spend much of their off-hours reading journals and
              decisions. They keep themselves up-to-date. And so must we. The
              relationship between you and your employer is spelled out nicely in
              your employment contract. In short: They promise to pay you, and you
              promise to do a good job.

            <p dir="auto">
              Professionals take responsibility for the code they write. They do
              not release code unless they know it works. Think about that for a
              minute. How can you possibly consider yourself a professional if you
              are willing to release code that you are not sure of? Professional
              programmers expect QA to find <em>nothing</em> because 
              <em>
                they don't release their code until they've thoroughly tested it
              </em>
              . Of course QA will find some problems, because no one is perfect.
              But as professionals our attitude must be that we will leave nothing
              for QA to find.

            <p dir="auto">
              Professionals are team players. They take responsibility for the
              output of the whole team, not just their own work. They help each
              other, teach each other, learn from each other, and even cover for
              each other when necessary. When one team-mate falls down, the others
              step in, knowing that one day they'll be the ones to need cover.

          <li>
            <p dir="auto">
              Professionals do not tolerate big bug lists. A huge bug list is
              sloppy. Systems with thousands of issues in the issue tracking
              database are tragedies of carelessness. Indeed, in most projects the
              very need for an issue tracking system is a symptom of carelessness.
              Only the very biggest systems should have bug lists so long that
              automation is required to manage them.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p dir="auto">
              Professionals do not make a mess. They take pride in their
              workmanship. They keep their code clean, well structured, and easy
              to read. They follow agreed upon standards and best practices. They
              never, <em>ever</em> rush. Imagine that you are having an
              out-of-body experience watching a doctor perform open-heart surgery
              on <em>you</em>. This doctor has a <em>deadline</em> (in the literal
              sense). He must finish before the heart-lung bypass machine damages
              too many of your blood cells. How do you want him to behave? Do you
              want him to behave like the typical software developer, rushing and
              making a mess? Do you want him to say: "I'll go back and fix this
              later?" Or do you want him to hold carefully to his disciplines,
              taking his time, confident that his approach is the best approach he
              can reasonably take. Do you want a mess, or professionalism?

          Professionals are responsible. They take responsibility for their own
          careers. They take responsibility for making sure their code works
          properly. They take responsibility for the quality of their workmanship.
          They do not abandon their principles when deadlines loom. Indeed, when
          the pressure mounts, professionals hold ever tighter to the disciplines
          they know are right.
