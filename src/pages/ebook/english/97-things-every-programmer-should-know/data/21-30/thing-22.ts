        Deliberate practice is not simply performing a task. If you ask
        yourself "Why am I performing this task?" and your answer is "To
        complete the task," then you're not doing deliberate practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform a task.
        It's about skill and technique. Deliberate practice means repetition.
        It means performing the task with the aim of increasing your mastery
        of one or more aspects of the task. It means repeating the repetition.
        Slowly, over and over again. Until you achieve your desired level of
        mastery. You do deliberate practice to master the task not to complete
        the task.

        The principal aim of paid development is to finish a product whereas
        the principal aim of deliberate practice is to improve your
        performance. They are not the same. Ask yourself, how much of your
        time do you spend developing someone else's product? How much
        developing yourself?

        worrying that you're just not expert material. You are. Greatness is
        largely a matter of conscious choice. Your choice. Research over the
        last two decades has shown the main factor in acquiring expertise is
        time spent doing deliberate practice. Innate ability is not the main

            practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging
            yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability,
            trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it,
