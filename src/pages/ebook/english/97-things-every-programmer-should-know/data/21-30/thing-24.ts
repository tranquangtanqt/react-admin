        Everyone with industry experience has undoubtedly worked on a project
        where the codebase was precarious at best. The system is poorly
        factored, and changing one thing always manages to break another
        unrelated feature. Whenever a module is added, the coder's goal is to
        change as little as possible, and hold their breath during every
        release. This is the software equivalent of playing Jenga with I-beams
        in a skyscraper, and is bound for disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason that making changes is so nerve wracking is because the
        system is sick. It needs a doctor, otherwise its condition will only
        worsen. You already know what is wrong with your system, but you are
        afraid of breaking the eggs to make your omelet. A skilled surgeon
        knows that cuts have to be made in order to operate, but the skilled
        surgeon also knows that the cuts are temporary and will heal. The end
        result of the operation is worth the initial pain, and the patient
        should heal to a better state than they were in before the surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't be afraid of your code. Who cares if something gets temporarily
        broken while you move things around? A paralyzing fear of change is
        what got your project into this state to begin with. Investing the
        time to refactor will pay for itself several times over the life cycle
        of your project. An added benefit is that your team's experience
        dealing with the sick system makes you all experts in knowing how it
        should work. Apply this knowledge rather than resent it. Working on a
        system you hate is not how anybody should have to spend their time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Redefine internal interfaces, restructure modules, refactor
        copy–pasted code, and simplify your design by reducing dependencies.
        You can significantly reduce code complexity by eliminating corner
        cases, which often result from improperly coupled features. Slowly
        transition the old structure into the new one, testing along the way.
        Trying to accomplish a large refactor in "one big shebang" will cause
        enough problems to make you consider abandoning the whole effort
        midway through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be the surgeon who isn't afraid to cut out the sick parts to make room
        for healing. The attitude is contagious and will inspire others to
        start working on those cleanup projects they've been putting off. Keep
        a "hygiene" list of tasks that the team feels are worthwhile for the
        general good of the project. Convince management that even though
        these tasks may not produce visible results, they will reduce expenses
        and expedite future releases. Never stop caring about the general
        "health" of the code.
