        If you look at any activity, process, or discipline from far enough
        away it looks simple. Managers with no experience of development think
        what programmers do is simple and programmers with no experience of
        management think the same of what managers do.
      </p>

        Programming is something some people do — some of the time. And the
        hard part — the thinking — is the least visible and least appreciated
        by the uninitiated. There have been many attempts to remove the need
        for this skilled thinking over the decades. One of the earliest and
        most memorable is the effort by Grace Hopper to make programming
        languages less cryptic — which some accounts predicted would remove
        the need for specialist programmers. The result (COBOL) has
        contributed to the income of many specialist programmers over
        subsequent decades.

        The persistent vision that software development can be simplified by
        removing programming is, to the programmer who understands what is
        involved, obviously naïve. But the mental process that leads to this
        mistake is part of human nature and programmers are just as prone to
        making it as everyone else.

        On any project there are likely many things that an individual
        programmer doesn't get actively involved in: eliciting requirements
        from users, getting budgets approved, setting up the build server,
        deploying the application to QA and production environments, migrating
        the business from the old processes or programs, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you aren't actively involved in things there is an unconscious
        tendency to assume that they are simple and happen "by magic." While
        the magic continues to happen all is well. But when — it is usually
        "when" and not "if" — the magic stops the project is in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've known projects lose weeks of developer time because no one
        understood how they relied on "the right" version of a DLL being
        loaded. When things started failing intermittently team members looked
        everywhere else before someone noticed that "a wrong" version of the
        DLL was being loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another department was running smoothly — projects delivered on time,
        no late night debugging sessions, no emergency fixes. So smoothly, in
        fact, that senior management decided that things "ran themselves" and
        they could do without the project manager. Inside six months the
        projects in the department looked just like the rest of the
        organization — late, buggy and continually being patched.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't have to understand all the magic that makes your project
        work, but it doesn't hurt to understand some of it — or to appreciate
        someone who understands the bits you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, make sure that when the magic stops it can be
        started again.
