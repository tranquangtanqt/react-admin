        Recently I was at a grocery store searching high and low for "edamame"
        (which I only vaguely knew was some kind of a vegetable). I wasn't sure
        whether this was something I'd find in the vegetable section, the frozen
        section, or in a can. I gave up and tracked down an employee to help me
        out. She didn't know either!
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The employee could have responded in many different ways. She could have
        made me feel ignorant for not knowing where to look, or given me vague
        possibilities, or even just told me they didn't have the item. But
        instead she treated the request as an opportunity to find a solution and
        help a customer. She called other employees and within minutes had
        guided me to the exact item, nestled in the frozen section.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        The employee in this case looked at a request and started from the
        premise that we would solve the problem and satisfy the request. She
        started from <em>yes</em> instead of starting from no.

        When I was first placed in a technical leadership role, I felt that my
        job was to protect my beautiful software from the ridiculous stream of
        demands coming from product managers and business analysts. I started
        most conversations seeing a request as something to defeat, not
        something to grant.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        At some point, I had an epiphany that maybe there was a different way to
        work that merely involved shifting my perspective from starting at no to
        starting at <em>yes</em>. In fact, I've come to believe that starting
        from <em>yes</em> is actually an essential part of being a technical
        leader.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        This simple change radically altered how I approached my job. As it
        turns out, there are a lot of ways to say <em>yes</em>. When someone
        says to you "Hey, this app would really be the bees knees if we made all
        the windows round and translucent!" you could reject it as ridiculous.
        But it's often better to start with "Why?" instead. Often there is some
        actual and compelling reason why that person is asking for round
        translucent windows in the first place. For example, you may be just
        about to sign a big new customer with a standards committee that
        mandates round translucent windows.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Usually you'll find that when you known the context of the request, new
        possibilities open up. It's common for the request to be accomplished
        with the existing product in some other way allowing you to say 
        <em>yes</em> with no work at all: "Actually, in the user preferences you
        can download the round translucent windows skin and turn it on."
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        Sometimes the other person will simply have an idea that you find
        incompatible with your view of the product. I find it's usually helpful
        to turn that "Why?" on yourself. Sometimes the act of voicing the reason
        will make it clear that your first reaction doesn't make sense. If not,
        you might need to kick it up a notch and bring in other key decision
        makers. Remember, the goal of all of this is to say <em>yes</em> to the
        other person and try to make it work, not just for him but for you and
        your team as well.
      </p>
      <p dir="auto">
        If you can voice a compelling explanation as to why the feature request
        is incompatible with the existing product, then you are likely to have a
        productive conversation about whether you are building the right
        product. Regardless of how that conversation concludes, everyone will
        focus more sharply on what the product is, and what it is not.
      </p>

        Starting from <em>yes</em> means working with your colleagues, not
        against them.
