            Documentation for java code is often generated using javadoc. Javadoc was created by Sun Microsystems for the purpose of generating API
            documentation in HTML format from java source code. Using the HTML format gives the convenience of being able to hyperlink related
            documents together.
          </p>

          <b>1. Building Javadocs From the Command Line</b>
          <div className="tab-1">
            <p>
              Many IDEs provide support for generating HTML from Javadocs automatically; some build tools (Maven and Gradle, for example) also have
              plugins that can handle the HTML creation.
            </p>
            <p>However, these tools are not required to generate the Javadoc HTML; this can be done using the command line javadoc tool.</p>
            <p>The most basic usage of the tool is:</p>
          </div>
          <div className="tab-2">
            <Code code={`javadoc JavaFile.java`} language="sql" />
          </div>
          <div className="tab-1">
            <p>Which will generate HTML from the Javadoc comments in JavaFile.java.</p>
            <p>
              A more practical use of the command line tool, which will recursively read all java files in [source-directory], create documentation
              for [package.name] and all sub-packages, and place the generated HTML in the [docsdirectory] is:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="tab-2">
            <Code code={`javadoc -d [docs-directory] -subpackages -sourcepath [source-directory] [package.name]`} language="sql" />
